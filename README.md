# BoilerGen

BoilerGen creates files from reusable templates and injects necessary code (e.g. imports, registrations) directly into your project ‚Äî without breaking existing code.

No more manual integration steps. No more forgotten imports. Just working boilerplate.

> üöß Work in progress: The project is currently not in a usable state. 


## Setup

1. [Install Python (3.11+) and pip](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
2. Clone this repository using    `git clone https://github.com/HumanBot000/BoilerGen.git`
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open your preferred command line and `cd` into the project directory.
5. Run `pip install -e .`
6. [Set up your first templates](x)  
7. Run `boilergen create` and follow the instructions.
‚Üí All available commands can be accessed by `boilergen --help`.


## Templates

Templates are pre-defined code snippets that can be reused across multiple projects with the same tech stack.  
If you already have a boilerplate repository, you may need to edit some snippets to follow [BoilerGen's tagging rules](x).

Templates are configured in the `boilergen/templates` directory and can be grouped into multiple subgroups [(see examples)](x).

## Template.yaml
Each template needs a `template.yaml` file for its Template Definition.
We highly encourage you to take a look at the  [(Example Templates)](x).
Otherwise, here is a quick breakdown:
```yaml
id: flask  
label: "Flask Base App"  
requires: [example]  
config:  
  debug: True  
  port: 5000
```
### Fields
| id       	| The technical identifier for this template (Must be unique across all Templates)                                                           	|
|----------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| label    	| The human-readable name of this Template (This will be shown in the Template browser)                                                      	|
| requires 	| List of templates this template relies on (dependence management). This will be needed for injections. Use the `id` field of the template. 	|
| config   	| A Map of default values for [boilergen configurations](x)                                                                                       	|
## Tagging

Often, multiple code snippets depend on each other and can't simply be copy-pasted and expected to work (e.g., special API routes need to be registered in the main API definition before startup). To simplify this process, BoilerGen uses a tagging system to automatically adjust your code.

```python
# <<boilergen:imports
from flask import Flask  
# boilergen:imports>>
```

> Depending on your language of choice, you may need to edit the [comment syntax](https://gist.github.com/dk949/88b2652284234f723decaeb84db2576c). BoilerGen will comply with this, but the core syntax remains the same.

### Tagging Syntax Explained

- `<<` indicates an opening tag.
- `>>` indicates a closing tag.
- The comment contains the keyword `boilergen`, identifying it as a special tag.
- After `boilergen`, a colon `:` and a unique identifier (e.g., `imports`) must follow.
- Everything between the tag lines is the tag's content and will be used for code injection.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Tag opening and closing definitions **may not happen inline**. They need their own line with with no additional syntax.
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è You **must not** use this exact syntax (`<<boilergen:...>>`) in any context not intended for BoilerGen. Doing so will corrupt your template.
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Identifiers must be unique **within** a template. We strongly recommend aslo keeping them unique **across** all templates to avoid confusion.

Example of unique identifiers:
```text
boilergen:main-template_imports
boilergen:main-template_routes
```
---

## Configurations

To simplify simple variations between projects (e.g., changing the app name or enabling debug mode), templates support configurable variables. These can be set in a `template.yaml` file or supplied interactively during `boilergen create`.

```python
debug = bool("boilergen:config | debug | True")
```

### Configuration Syntax Explained

- Follows the same general structure as tagging.
- Does **not** require a unique identifier after the colon.
- The format is:  
  `boilergen:config | config_name | default_value`
- The `default_value` is optional, but must be provided at some point.

Example:
```python
app.run(
    host='boilergen:config | IP | "0.0.0.0"',
    port="boilergen:config | port",
    debug=debug
)
```

> In this example:
> - `host` will be parsed as a `str ("0.0.0.0")` .
> - `debug` is already parsed using `bool(...)` above

We **strongly recommend** not placing configuration tags inside **inline comments**, as this may break the syntax highlighting and parsing in your language-specific editor or runtime. BoilerGen tries to **verify data types**, but we **strongly recommend** accepting them as **Strings** and parsing them individually, depending on your language,

### Configuration Precedence

The order of precedence for resolving configuration values is:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    step1: CLI input during project creation
    step2: Value from template.yaml
    step3: Default value in template
    step1 --> step2
    step2 --> step3
```
